# Optimization
1) **Evolution Strategy (ES):** The basic algorithm in Python 
2) **Evolution Strategy (ES):** With single adaptive mutation step-size in Python
3) **Hill Climbing:** This is a *local search* algorithm that always tries to go up the hill of the fitness landspace. However, it gets stuck into local maxima. The Python code along an example is provided here.
4) **Simulated Annealing:** This is a metaheuristic to find hopefully the global optimum (minimum). It can be viewed as a combination of *Hill Climbing* and *random walk*. The code in python with two examples is given.
